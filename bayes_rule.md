Week 2:

When the denominator probability of A is not given, it has to be computed. 
When we we do that, we get the expanded version of Bayes' formula. 
So, the key to applying Bayes' rule is, to always first try the simpler version (1),
and if the denominator is not given, then we try the more complicated version (2).
