sometimes it turns out that the denominator probability of A is not directly given to us, 
and we have to compute it. And we do that just as we computed the probability of money 
on the previous slide. And if we do that, we get the expanded version of Bayes' formula 
which looks like that. So, the key to applying Bayes' rule is, to always first try the simpler version,
 and then if it turns out that we don't know the denominator, then we try the more complicated version.
